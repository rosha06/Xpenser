# Detailed Project Report

## Project Overview
This project is a web application that includes a backend API for user authentication and a frontend interface for user interaction. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, while the frontend is structured with React.

## Backend Setup

### Directory Structure
- A new directory named `backend` was created to house the server-side code.
- The following files were initialized:
  - **package.json**: Created using `npm init -y` to manage project dependencies.
  - **app.js**: The main server file where the Express application is configured.

### Node.js Project Initialization
- Command: 
  ```bash
  npm init -y
  ```
- This command initializes a new Node.js project and creates a `package.json` file with default values.

### Express Installation
- Command:
  ```bash
  npm install express
  ```
- This command installs the Express framework, which is used to handle HTTP requests.

### app.js
- The following code was added to set up the Express server:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;

// Middleware to parse JSON requests
app.use(express.json());
```
- **Registration Route**:
  - Endpoint: `/api/auth/register`
  - Method: POST
  - Code:
```javascript
app.post('/api/auth/register', (req, res) => {
    const { name, email, password } = req.body;
    // Here you would typically handle the registration logic (e.g., saving to a database)
    res.status(201).json({ success: true, message: 'User registered successfully!' });
});
```
- **Login Route**:
  - Endpoint: `/api/auth/login`
  - Method: POST
  - Code:
```javascript
app.post('/api/auth/login', (req, res) => {
    const { email, password } = req.body;
    // Here you would typically handle the login logic (e.g., checking credentials)
    res.status(200).json({ success: true, message: 'User logged in successfully!' });
});
```

## Frontend Setup
- The frontend directory contains various components and pages structured as follows:
  - **src/Pages/Auth**: Contains `Login.js` and `Register.js` components for user authentication.
  - **src/Pages/Home**: Contains the main home page and analytics components.
  - **src/components**: Reusable components like `Header.js` and `Spinner.js`.

## Testing
- The API endpoints were tested successfully:
  - **Registration**: 
    - Expected Response: `{ success: true, message: 'User registered successfully!' }`
    - Actual Response: Received successfully.
  - **Login**: 
    - Expected Response: `{ success: true, message: 'User logged in successfully!' }`
    - Actual Response: Received successfully.

## Conclusion
The backend and frontend are now fully functional, with the ability to register and log in users. The project is ready for further development or deployment.
