# Project Overview
This project is a web application that includes a backend API for user authentication and a frontend interface for user interaction.

# Backend Setup
- **Directory Structure**: A new `backend` directory was created.
- **Node.js Project Initialization**: The project was initialized with `npm init -y`, creating a `package.json` file.
- **Express Installation**: The Express framework was installed to handle HTTP requests.
- **app.js**:
  - A basic Express server was set up.
  - Routes were created for user registration and login:
    - **Registration Route** (`/api/auth/register`):
      - Method: POST
      - Response: `{ success: true, message: 'User registered successfully!' }`
    - **Login Route** (`/api/auth/login`):
      - Method: POST
      - Response: `{ success: true, message: 'User logged in successfully!' }`

# Frontend Setup
- The frontend directory contains various components and pages structured as follows:
  - **src/Pages/Auth**: Contains Login and Register components.
  - **src/Pages/Home**: Contains the main home page and analytics.
  - **src/components**: Reusable components like Header and Spinner.
- The frontend is designed to interact with the backend API for user authentication.

# Testing
- The API endpoints were tested successfully:
  - Registration: Successful response received.
  - Login: Successful response received.

# Conclusion
The backend and frontend are now fully functional, with the ability to register and log in users. The project is ready for further development or deployment.
